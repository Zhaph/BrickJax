# BrickJax Brick Image Replacement for Bricks.StackExchange.com
## Welcome to the provisional home of BrickJax

This is a work-in-progress proof-of-concept to show how we might provide some script to replace some tags on [Bricks Stack Exchange](http://bricks.stackexchange.com) with pictures sourced from [LUGNet Parts Guide](http://guide.lugnet.com/partsref/).

When it's complete, the aim is that you would be able to take a reference to the BrickJax script and then where ever it finds matching tags, it replaces them with an image.

The supported tags are:

    [part:3700:4]
    Draw a part (Technic Brick 1 x 2 with Hole) in a colour (red).
    [partlink:3700:4]
    Draw a part (Technic Brick 1 x 2 with Hole) in a colour (red) and link to it on Peeron.com.
    [set:5590]
    Link to set 5590 on Peeron.
    [bl:5590]
    Link to set 5590 on BrickLink.
    [bs:5590]
    Link to set 5590 on BrickSet.

These codes should be replaced by images:  
[PART:3001:14]  
[parT:2337]  
[part:777p06]  
[part:6260c01:21]  
[part:884]
